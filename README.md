# Functions-for-Manipulating-Data-in-PostgreSQL
A practical walkthrough of PostgreSQL’s most powerful built-in functions for transforming and formatting data. This project demonstrates how to use scalar, string, numeric, and date/time functions to clean, enrich, and prepare data for analysis.

# Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL

A hands-on SQL project exploring PostgreSQL’s built-in functions for transforming, formatting, and cleaning data. Based on the DataCamp course *Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL*, this repository showcases practical use of text, numeric, date/time, and type conversion functions — all optimized for real-world business needs.

## 🎯 Project Description

This project demonstrates how PostgreSQL’s scalar and formatting functions can be used to:

* Clean and standardize messy input
* Enrich and calculate derived columns
* Convert between data types
* Build layered logic with chained functions

The queries are organized thematically and paired with documentation and examples to serve as a reference toolkit for data professionals.

## 🛠️ Key Skills Practiced

* 🔤 **String functions**: `LOWER()`, `INITCAP()`, `TRIM()`, `REPLACE()`
* 🔢 **Numeric functions**: `ROUND()`, `CEIL()`, `FLOOR()`, arithmetic expressions
* 🕒 **Date/time functions**: `AGE()`, `EXTRACT()`, `NOW()`, `DATE_TRUNC()`
* 🔁 **Type casting**: `CAST()`, `::`, converting between text, int, date, etc.
* 🔗 **Function chaining**: Nesting multiple transformations in a single expression
