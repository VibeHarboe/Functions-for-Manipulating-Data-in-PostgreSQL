# üìÅ SQL Queries ‚Äì Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL

This folder contains practice-ready SQL queries structured around PostgreSQL's built-in functions for inspecting, transforming, and cleaning data. Each `.sql` file is organized thematically and uses real data from the Sakila DVD rental dataset.

## ‚úÖ Query Standards

- All queries are written in PostgreSQL syntax and follow modular, reusable formatting.
- Section headers and in-line comments are included for easy navigation and learning.
- Sample queries are ordered by real-world use case relevance and function category.

---

## üõ† Usage Notes

- All examples assume the **Sakila DVD Rental** schema is loaded.
- Use `LIMIT` when previewing large datasets.
- Many queries highlight multiple ways to accomplish the same task for comparison (e.g., `SUBSTRING` vs `SPLIT_PART`).
